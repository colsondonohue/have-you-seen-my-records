## How It Works

Have You Seen My Records? uses your top 200 most played albums to assess your 'indie-cred'.
It assigns each album a critical acclaim score based on Pitchfork Music reviews (the fount of indie knowledge)
and an obscurity score based on the ratio of album listeners to listeners of Last.fm's most popular album.
The final score out of 100 is an average of the 200 album scores, weighted based on plays.
